# BoostPhysioClinic
Java console-based clinic booking system with support for patient registration, physiotherapist management, appointment scheduling, and reporting â€” with full JUnit testing

This project is a Java-based console application developed for simulating a real-world booking system for the Boost Physio Clinic.
 
It allows patients to register, view and book treatments with physiotherapists based on expertise or name, manage appointments, and generate operational reports.

The system includes:

Patient and physiotherapist management

Appointment booking, cancelling, and attending

Two booking modes: by expertise and by physiotherapist name

4-week treatment schedule simulation

System reports with physiotherapist performance stats

JUnit 5 test coverage for key functionalities

Built using core Java, organized as a menu-driven console app, and tested with JUnit 5. No external database required.
